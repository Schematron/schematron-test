# Schematron test files

These are test files for testing Schematron implementations.

The initial test files were moved here from the 'Schematron/schematron' project.

In an ideal world, this would include test files for every testable statement in the ISO standard.  If you can add one or two test files, please do so.

In an even more ideal world, tests would also have accompanying XSpec files so that they can be tested using XSpec.  The priority, however, is the tests themselves, since not every Schematron implementation can be run by the XSpec framework.
